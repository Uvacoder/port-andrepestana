I used to play the drums but it&#39;s an instrument that is hard to keep and maintain. It requires space and everybody knows how noisy it is. Lately I&#39;ve been giving more attention to the Guitars. I&#39;m practicing some easy songs through Youtube and having so much fun with my daughter.</p>',6);function c(a,p,g,b,f,m){return n(),s("div",null,[e("h1",l,[i(o(a.$frontmatter.title)+" ",1),h]),u])}const k=t(d,[["render",c]]);export{v as __pageData,k as default};
